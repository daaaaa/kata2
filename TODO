In bowling there are:
  - rolls
  - frames
  - pins

In a bowling game a player has 10 frames.
At the beginning of a frame, all 10 pins are placed.

In each frame a player has 2 rolls. If a player:
  - (case 1) eliminates all the pins in the first roll of a frame, he does a strike and the current frame terminates.
  - does not eliminate all the pins in the first rolls, he proceeds with the second roll of the frame and if the player:
    - (case 2) eliminates all the remaining pins, he does a spare and the current frame terminates
    - (case 3) does not eliminate all the remaining pins, the current frame terminates.

In:
 - (case 3) the player gets many points as many pins he eliminated
 - (case 2) the player gets 10 point plus the number of pins eliminated in the next roll
 - (case 1) the player gets 10 points plus the number of pins eliminated in the next two rolls

Examples:
1) If a player does three consecutive strikes and two [0,0] frame, he gets:
  - 30 points for the first frame (10 + 10 + 10), the sum of the strike and the next two rolls (two strikes)
  - 20 points for the second frame (10 + 10 + 0), the sum of the strike and the next two rolls (one strike and a [0,0] frame)
  - 10 points for the third frame (10 + 0 + 0) the sum of the strike and the next two rolls
  - 0 points for the fourth and fifth frames
2) If a player does a strike, a spare [6,4] and a [2,1] point frame, he gets:
  - 20 points for the first frame (10 + 6 + 4), the sum of the strike and the next two rolls (6 and 4)
  - 12 points for the second frame ((6 + 4) + 2), the sum of the spare and the next roll (2)
  - 3 points for the third frame (2 + 1), the sum of the frame
3) If a player does a spare [5, 5] and a spare [0,10], he gets:
  - 10 points for the first frame ((5 + 5) + 0), the sum of the spare and the next frame (0)
  - 10 points for the second frame, the sum of the frame

The last and tenth frame is and exception:
  - spare and strikes does not give any bonus
  - if the player does a spare, the player will have an additional roll in the frame
  - if the player does a strike at his first rolls, the player will do two additional rolls.


Requirement 1
Given an array of numbers representing a finished game, return an object with the following structure:
{
  total: number
}
where total is the total point scored in a game.

Requirement 2
Given an array of numbers representing a finished game, return an object with the following structure:
{
  total: null || number
  valid: boolean,
  error: null || BOWLING_ERROR
}

If the array represents a valid game, returns:
{
  total: number
  valid: false,
  error: null
}

Otherwise return:
{
  total: null
  valid: true,
  error: BOWLING_ERROR
}

Where bowling error is:
- 'Invalid frame', if the sum of a frame is invalid
- 'Too many rolls', if the number of rolls is higher than the number of rolls of a valid game
- 'Not enough rolls', if the number of rolls is not enough to have a valid game
- 'Invalid roll', if a roll has a value higher than 10 or lower than 0


Requirement 3
Given a an array of numbers representing the game and an array of numbers representing frame numbers,
returns a number representing the final score of the game, and an array corresponding respectively to the score at the nth frame.
